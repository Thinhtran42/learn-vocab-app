# English Learning App - Vision & MVP Plan

## üéØ Product Vision
Create an English learning app that helps users actively engage with vocabulary through image association, pronunciation practice, contextual usage, and AI integration.

## ‚ú® MVP Features (Phase 1)
- **Topic-based vocabulary learning** with meaning, image, and pronunciation.
- **User-added vocabulary**: users input a word, app auto-finds meaning, image, usage using GPT + image APIs.
- **Pronunciation practice** using speech recognition (Web Speech API / Whisper).
- **Mindmap display** for visual vocabulary connection (e.g., react-flow).
- **Spaced Repetition (SRS)** using SM-2 algorithm (like Anki).

## üöÄ Phase 2 Expansion Ideas
- Read English news with **highlight & save vocabulary**.
- Learn English via short videos (subtitle interaction).
- **Matchmaking for conversation practice** via WebRTC or integration.

## ü§ñ AI Integration
- GPT-4 for: definition, example usage, dialogue generation.
- Whisper/Web Speech API for: voice input & pronunciation scoring.
- Auto-content generation (quiz, spaced review scheduling).

## üß† Development Stack Suggestions
- Frontend: React Native or Flutter
- Backend: Firebase, Supabase or Node.js + MongoDB/Postgres
- AI Integration: OpenAI API (GPT, Whisper), Unsplash/Pexels API (images)
- Mindmap: react-flow, Mermaid.js

## üñåÔ∏è UI/UX Prompt for AI
```
Design a mobile app interface for an English vocabulary learning app. The UI should be clean, modern, and friendly for students aged 15-35. The app includes:

- Home screen with topic-based vocabulary categories (e.g., Food, Travel)
- Vocabulary card with word, IPA, definition, usage sentence, image
- Voice pronunciation test with feedback
- Mindmap screen showing related vocabulary visually
- Add word screen (fetches meaning, usage, image)
- Review schedule (spaced repetition)

Use soft colors (green, blue, pastel) and rounded buttons.
```
